# Write and Run Scripts in Python

## Project Overview

**Script:** Script_4.py  
**Title:** Malicious File Detection & Neutralization  
**Author:** Luis Cruz  
**Date:** April 2025

This Python script automates the detection of malicious files within client directories by:

- Scanning all client files for suspicious prefixes or embedded IP addresses
- Renaming any detected malicious files by changing their extension to .txt to neutralize them

## Folder Structure

Make sure your working directory contains a folder named `clients_sites/` with the files to be scanned.
